        <h4>ACT ONE SCENE I (Music Master, Dancing Master, Musicians, and Dancers)</h4>

        

        <p>
            <p class="speech">(The play opens with a great assembly of instruments, and in the
                middle of the stage is a pupil of the Music Master seated at a
                table composing a melody which Monsieur Jourdain has ordered for a
                serenade.)</p>

            <h6 class="name MUSICMASTER">MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">(To Musicians) Come, come into this room, sit there
                and wait until he comes.</p>

            <h6 class ="name DANCINGMASTER">DANCING MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">(To dancers) And you too, on this side.</p>

            <h6 class="name MUSICMASTER">MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">(To Pupil) Is it done?</p>

            <h6 class="name PUPIL">PUPIL:</h6>
            <p class="speech">Yes.</p>

            <h6 class="name MUSICMASTER">MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">Let's see... This is good.</p>

            <h6 class ="name DANCINGMASTER">DANCING MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">Is it something new?</p>

            <h6 class="name MUSICMASTER">MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">Yes, it's a melody for a serenade that I set him to
                composing here, while waiting for our man to awake.</p>

            <h6 class ="name DANCINGMASTER">DANCING MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">May I see it?</p>

            <h6 class="name MUSICMASTER">MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">You'll hear it, with the dialogue, when he comes.  He
                won't be long.</p>

            <h6 class ="name DANCINGMASTER">DANCING MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">Our work, yours and mine, is not trivial at
                present.
                </p>

            <h6 class="name MUSICMASTER">MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">This is true. We've found here such a man as we both
                need. This is a nice source of income for us--this Monsieur
                Jourdain, with the visions of nobility and gallantry that he has
                gotten into his head. You and I should hope that everyone resembled
                him.</p>

            <h6 class ="name DANCINGMASTER">DANCING MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">Not entirely; I could wish that he understood
                better the things that we give him.</p>

            <h6 class="name MUSICMASTER">MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">It's true that he understands them poorly, but he
                pays well, and that's what our art needs now more than anything
                else.</p>

            <h6 class ="name DANCINGMASTER">DANCING MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">As for me, I admit, I feed a little on glory.
                Applause touches me; and I hold that, in all the fine arts, it is
                painful to produce for dolts, to endure the barbarous opinions of a
                fool about my choreography. It is a pleasure, don't tell me
                otherwise, to work for people who can appreciate the fine points of
                an art, who know how to give a sweet reception to the beauties of a
                work and, by pleasurable approbations, gratify us for our labor.
                Yes, the most agreeable recompense we can receive for the things we
                do is to see them recognized and flattered by an applause that
                honors us. There is nothing, in my opinion, that pays us better for
                all our fatigue; and it is an exquisite delight to receive the
                praises of the well-informed.</p>

            <h6 class="name MUSICMASTER">MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">I agree, and I enjoy them as you do. There is surely
                nothing more agreeable than the applause you speak of; but that
                incense does not provide a living. Pure praises do not provide a
                comfortable existence; it is necessary to add something solid, and
                the best way to praise is to praise with cash-in-hand.  He's a man,
                it's true, whose insight is very slight, who talks nonsense about
                everything and applauds only for the wrong reasons but his money
                makes up for his judgments. He has discernment in his purse. His
                praises are in cash, and this ignorant bourgeois is worth more to
                us, as you see, than the educated nobleman who introduced us here.
                </p>

            <h6 class ="name DANCINGMASTER">DANCING MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">There is some truth in what you say; but I find
                that you lean a little too heavily on money; and material interest
                is something so base that a man of good taste should never show an
                attachment to it.</p>

            <h6 class="name MUSICMASTER">MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">You are ready enough to receive the money our man
                gives you.
                </p>

            <h6 class ="name DANCINGMASTER">DANCING MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">Assuredly; but I don't place all my happiness in
                it, and I could wish that together with his fortune he had some
                good taste in things.</p>

            <h6 class="name MUSICMASTER">MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">I could wish it too, that's what both of us are
                working for as much as we can.  But, in any case, he gives us the
                means to make ourselves known in the world; and he will pay others
                if they will praise him.</p>

            <h6 class ="name DANCINGMASTER">DANCING MASTER:</h6>
            <p class="speech">Here he comes.</p>
